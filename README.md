# Supply Chain Simulation and Predictive Analytics

This project combines an agent-based supply chain simulation with machine learning-based predictive analytics to support supply chain decision making.

## Overview

The system consists of two main components:
1. **Supply Chain Simulation**: Generates synthetic data by simulating a network of suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and retailers
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Analyzes the simulation data to forecast future demand, optimize inventory levels, predict disruptions, and estimate lead times

## Features

### Simulation Features
- Multi-echelon supply chain with configurable number of entities
- Realistic agent behaviors including ordering policies, production planning, and inventory management
- Seasonal demand patterns and random variability
- Supply disruptions and capacity constraints
- Network effects and interactions between entities

### Analytics Features
- Demand forecasting using ML models (XGBoost or Random Forest)
- Inventory optimization with safety stock calculations
- Supply chain disruption prediction
- Lead time estimation and analysis
- Performance metrics and visualizations
